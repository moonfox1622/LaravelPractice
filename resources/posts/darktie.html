    Take back the city of Tertium from hordes of bloodthirsty foes in this intense and brutal action shooter.
    Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the new co-op focused experience from the award-winning team behind the
    Vermintide series.
    In the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A
    mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your
    allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos.
    As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise.
